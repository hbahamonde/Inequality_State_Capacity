	Abstract = {A large body of scholarship finds a negative relationship between natural resources and democracy. Extant cross-country regressions, however, assume random effects and are run on panel datasets with relatively short time dimensions. Because natural resource reliance is not an exogenous variable, this is not an effective strategy for uncovering causal relationships. Numerous sources of bias may be driving the results, the most serious of which is omitted variable bias induced by unobserved country-specific and time-invariant heterogeneity. To address these problems, we develop unique historical datasets, employ time-series centric techniques, and operationalize explicitly specified counterfactuals. We test to see if there is a long-run relationship between resource reliance and regime type within countries over time, both on a country-by-country basis and across several different panels. We find that increases in resource reliance are not associated with authoritarianism. In fact, in many specifications we generate results that suggest a resource blessing.},

	Abstract = {How does regime type affect the poor? Are certain types of regimes better at translating economic growth into consumption for the world's least privileged citizens? We propose an alternative measure of transfers to the poor that is nearly universally available and innately captures distribution: average daily calorie consumption. In sharp contrast to the consumption of material goods or the accumulation of wealth for which humans have shown no upper bound on their ability to achieve, biological limits make it impossible for a small number of individuals to consume most of a nation's calories. Democracies and hybrid regimes---which combine elements of autocracy and democracy---are better at translating economic growth into total calorie consumption than autocracies and perform strikingly similarly in this regard; democracies outperform both hybrid regimes and autocracies, however, in converting growth into higher quality calories from animal sources.},

@article{Choi2001,
	Abstract = {This paper develops unit root tests for panel data. These tests are devised under more general assumptions than the tests previously proposed. First, the number of groups in the panel data is assumed to be either finite or infinite. Second, each group is assumed to have different types of nonstochastic and stochastic components. Third, the time series spans for the groups are assumed to be all different. Fourth, the alternative where some groups have a unit root and others do not can be dealt with by the tests. The tests can also be used for the null of stationarity and for cointegration, once relevant changes are made in the model, hypotheses, assumptions and underlying tests. The main idea for our unit root tests is to combine p-values from a unit root test applied to each group in the panel data. Combining p-values to formulate tests is a common practice in meta-analysis. This paper also reports the finite sample performance of our combination unit root tests and Im et al.'s [Mimeo (1995)] t-bar test. The results show that most of the combination tests are more powerful than the t-bar test in finite samples. Application of the combination unit root tests to the post-Bretton Woods US real exchange rate data provides some evidence in favor of the PPP hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Seekings2011,
	Abstract = {By comparison with most African countries, post-apartheid South Africa appears to be characterised by growth-oriented cooperation between state and business. Economic growth has remained weak, however, and income poverty persists as the economy continues down an inegalitarian growth path that fails to reduce unemployment and thus has little effect on poverty. This paper argues that the appearance of close state-business relations is misleading: selectively pro-market public policies have not reflected a pro-business orien- tation on the part of the state. The governing African National Congress concurred with established business on the need for increased productivity and selective state interventions in a mixed economy. But most of the political elite overestimated the commandist powers of the state in the short-term, viewed established South African business with deep suspicion if not hostility, and was unwilling to deliberate or negotiate on distributional issues in either formal bilateral or corporatist institutions, or even informally. The state sought to discipline and transform business, not work with it. Unable to sustain an active growth coalition, a pro-poor, developmental coalition was far out of reach. The politics of the governing party precluded substantive concessions on labour market regulation and pushed it towards ever more interventionist `black economic empowerment' policies. The result was that economic growth remained modest, and of little benefit to the poor.},

The level of financial development conditions the impact of financial liberalization on inequality. Also the quality of political institutions conditions the impact of financial liberalization on income inequality, in contrast to the quality of economic institutions.

@unpublished{Denk2015,
	Abstract = {Using data from OECD countries over the past three decades, this paper shows that financial expansion has fuelled greater income inequality. Higher levels of credit intermediation and stock markets are both related with a more unequal distribution of income. Greater income inequality may not reduce the welfare of even the lowest earners so long as their income growth is not negatively affected. Numerical simulations based on a novel empirical methodology indicate, however, that the financial expansion has put a brake on the income growth of many low- and middle-income households. No evidence is found that financial crises explain the observed relationships. While causality is difficult to establish beyond doubt, the paper finds credit patterns which are inconsistent with reverse causality running from greater income inequality to more household borrowing.},

	Abstract = {This paper critically reviews the literature on finance and inequality, highlighting substantive gaps in the literature. Finance plays a crucial role in most theories of persistent inequality. Unsurprisingly, therefore, economic theory provides a rich set of predictions concerning both the impact of finance on inequality and about the relevant mechanisms. Although subject to ample qualifications, the bulk of empirical research suggests that improvements in financial contracts, markets, and intermediaries expand economic opportunities and reduce inequality. Yet, there is a shortage of theoretical and empirical research on the potentially enormous impact of formal financial sector policies, such as bank regulations and securities law, on persistent inequality. Furthermore, there is no conceptual framework for considering the joint and endogenous evolution of finance, inequality, and economic growth.},

Using data from the period 1951-92, we examine the consequences of pooling for models of militarized disputes and bilateral trade. When pooled models are reestimated to allow for stable but unobserved differences among dyads, the results are altered in fundamental ways.},

	Abstract = {Objective. Cross-national research on the causes and consequences of income inequality has been hindered by the limitations of existing inequality data sets: greater coverage across countries and over time is available from these sources only at the cost of significantly reduced comparability across observations. The goal of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) is to overcome these limitations. Methods. A custom missing-data algorithm was used to standardize the U.N. University's World Income Inequality Database; data collected by the Luxembourg Income Study served as the standard. Results. The SWIID provides comparable Gini indices of gross and net income inequality for 153 countries for as many years as possible from 1960 to the present, along with estimates of uncertainty in these statistics. Conclusions. By maximizing comparability for the largest possible sample of countries and years, the SWIID is better suited to broad cross-national research on income inequality than previously available sources.},

We examine the relationship by asking two questions: How confident are we in our cross-national measures of good governance? How solid are the empirical foundations of the growth-governance causal linkage? Our results suggest that the dominant measures of governance are problematic, suffering from perceptual biases, adverse selection in sampling, and conceptual conflation with economic policy choices. Within the limits of somewhat problematic measures, the evidence suggests that there is far more reason to believe that growth and development spur improvements in governance than vice versa. The policy implications are profound, for international organizations and governments are beginning to condition developmental aid on problematic measures of administrative performance.},

	Abstract = {While much research in political economy points out the benefits of "limited government", political scientists have long emphasized the problems created in many less-developed nations by "weak states", which lack the power to tax and regulate the economy and to withstand the political and social challenges from non-state actors. I construct a model in which the state apparatus is controlled by a self-interested ruler, who tries to divert resources for his own consumption, but who can also invest in socially productive public goods. Both weak and strong states create distortions. When the state is excessively strong, the ruler imposes such high taxes that economic activity is stifled. When the state is excessively weak, the ruler anticipates that he will not be able to extract rents in the future and underinvests in public goods. I show that the same conclusion applies in the analysis of both the economic power of the state (i.e., its ability to raise taxes) and its political power (i.e., its ability to remain entrenched from the citizens). I also discuss how under certain circumstances a different type of equilibrium, which I refer to as "consensually strong state equilibrium", can emerge whereby the state is politically weak but is allowed to impose high taxes as long as a sufficient fraction of the proceeds are invested in public goods. The consensually strong state might best correspond to the state in OECD countries where taxes are high despite significant control by the society over the government. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
	Annote = {. The main argument of the paper is that both weak and strong states create distortions in
the allocation of resources, and consequently, both excessively weak and excessively strong
states are likely to act as impediments to economic development. While strong states tend
to impose high taxes, discouraging investment and entrepreneurial effort by the citizens,
weak states fail to invest in public goods such as infrastructure, roads, legal rules for
contract enforcement, etc. Weak states underinvest in public goods because self-interested
political elites undertake investments only when they expect future private rewards, and
when the state is weak, they can appropriate fewer rewards in the future. The key for this
result is that the state also takes actions that are important for the efficient functioning of
the economy; this necessitates an organization of society that provides the right incentives
to the self-interested agents controlling the state.

. Intermediate levels of taxes that both encourage
investment by the citizens and leave enough surplus for the ruler to entice him to invest
in public goods are necessary for good economic outcomes.

The argument is couched generally, but it derives from a large, ongoing empirical research project into the development of power in human societ- ies (i). At the moment, my generalisations are bolder about agrar- ian societies ; concerning industrial societies I will be more tentative. I define the state and then pursue the implications of that definition. I discuss two essential parts of the definition, centrality and territoriality, in relation to two types of STATE power, termed here DESPOTIC and INFRASTRUCTURAL POWER. I argue that state autonomy, of both despotic and infrastructural forms, flows principally from the state's unique ability to provide a territorially-centralised form of organizatio},

In light of that variation, this article has three goals: first, we critique existing academic research on the quality of governance in light of work on decentralized governance in Africa; second, we provide a conceptual map of how to theorize subnational variation in the quality of governance in settings characterized by considerable dependence on higher authorities for revenues; and third, we outline a series of data initiatives that offer the opportunity to study local and regional politics in new and exciting ways across the region. We conclude with great optimism about the prospects for innovative work on decentralized governance within countries across the region.},

@article{DeLaO2008a,
	Annote = {. This article asks whether religion undermines the negative relationship
between income and left voting that is assumed in standard political economy models of democracy.

. Analysis of cross-country survey data reveals that this
correlation disappears among religious individuals in countries that use pro-
portional representation. 

. This is the case in large part because there is a moral
values dimension that has a correlation with income that is equal in magni-
tude but has the opposite sign as the economic dimension, and the votes of
the religious are better explained by their positions on moral than economic
issues, especially in countries with multiparty systems. 

. Moral values --{\textgreater} religion (not economic --{\textgreater} religion).

. The main result is clearly driven by the proportional representation
(PR) systems. In the majoritarian systems, on the other hand, low-income
groups are somewhat more likely to vote for the left, but this difference is
the same for religious and secular individuals. Moreover, secular individu-
als are a bit more likely to vote for the left, and this difference does not vary
with income.

. Voters in systems with single-member elec-
toral districts generally face a choice between two viable parties at the dis-
trict level, and in practice, as Roemer's (1998) model assumes, the party of
the economic right is often the party that appeals to more religious voters as
well. In the proportional systems of continental Europe, on the other hand,
a greater diversity of parties creates the possibility that a party of the eco-
nomic right, for instance, can craft platforms that appeal to secular voters, or
that left-wing economic platforms can be combined with platforms that
appeal to religious voters. Thus, the greater differentiation in left voting by
income and especially religiosity demonstrated in Figure 3 under propor-
tional representation is likely a reflection of the differentiation in party plat-
forms on multiple issue dimensions under proportional representation.

. In sum, country-by-country probit analysis revealed that both of the issue
scales help predict vote choice in every country analyzed here. However, vot-
ers appear to place greater weight on economic issues in countries with
majoritarian electoral rules. In countries with proportional representation,
voters in societies with large Catholic populations place greater weight on
moral values issues.},

Empirically, however, these claims either rest on a small number of case studies or samples subject to severe selection bias. In this paper, I present a model showing that inequality does not systematically affect the probability that non-democracies transit to- ward democracy, but that, once established, equal democracies are unlikely to collapse. Using a Markov transition model and a dataset covering about 2400 country-years between 1950 and 2001, I indeed find that contrary to what the previous theoretical research has predicted inequality has no systematic effect on democratization. Inequality does, however, destabilize already established democracies.},

Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10{\%} of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

@article{Hanson2015,
	Abstract = {When it comes to social welfare, we do not have clear understanding of whether it is more important to have democracy or a capable state. Specifically, most studies do not consider the possibility that effects of democracy are conditioned or obscured by differences in the capabilities of states to deliver services effectively. This article contends that better developmental outcomes can result from either democracy or state capacity, but the combination of high levels of both democracy and state capacity is not synergistic. Empirical evidence from a time-series-cross-sectional dataset covering up to 162 countries during the 1965-2010 time period supports the conclusion that these factors partially substitute for each other with respect to improving outcomes in school enrollment and infant mortality. These findings provide a more optimistic answer to the query of Ross (Am J Polit Sci 50(4): 860-874, ) as to whether democracy is good for the poor. Once accounting for state capacity, we find that democracy leads to better development outcomes.},

	Abstract = {This paper uses heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques to estimate the long-run effect of income inequality on per-capita income for 46 countries over the period 1970--1995. We find that inequality has a negative long-run effect on income, both for the sample as a whole and for important sub-groups within the sample (developed countries, developing countries, democracies, and non-democracies). The effect is economically important, with a magnitude about half as high as the magnitude of an increase in the investment share. Copyright The Author(s) 2012},

@article{Morgan2013,
	Abstract = {This article analyzes how politics influences Latin American and Caribbean income inequality. Most studies view the distributional process in two phases with inequality shaped first by markets and then by state redistribution. Typically, cross-national analyses of inequality limit the influence of politics to the redistributive phase. But we argue that a full understanding of how government affects inequality must also consider how politics shapes the market. While redistribution is undoubtedly an important mechanism employed by government to influence distributional outcomes, we find that inequality produced by the market is more responsive to politics than is redistribution. Left partisan power and public investment in human capital significantly reduce inequality in the market phase. In addition, social spending on human capital conditions the effect of economic growth. As human capital investment increases, growth becomes more equality enhancing, providing further evidence of the market conditioning effect of policy.},

	Abstract = {It is well established that all interactions are symmetric: when the effect of X on Y is conditional on the value of Z, the effect of Z must be conditional on the value of X. Yet the typical practice when testing an interactive theory is to (1) view one variable, Z, as the conditioning variable, (2) offer a hypothesis about how the marginal effect of the other variable, X, is conditional on the value of Z, and (3) construct a marginal effect plot for X to test the theory. We show that the failure to make additional predictions about how the effect of Z varies with the value of X, and to evaluate them with a second marginal effect plot, means that scholars often ignore evidence that can be extremely valuable for testing their theory. As a result, they either understate or, more worryingly, overstate the support for their theories.},

	Abstract = {Recent work has documented an upward trend in inequality since the 1970s that harks back to the Gilded Age: the inegalitarian pre--World War I world. Most prominently, Thomas Piketty argues in Capital in the Twenty-First Century that this is partially due to the fact that capitalism is hardwired to exacerbate the gap between the rich and poor. By critically evaluating recent literature on this topic, this article offers three big contributions. First, we advance an alternative explanation for the long-term U-shaped nature of inequality that Piketty examines. Political regime types and the social groups they empower, rather than war and globalization, can account for the sharp fall and then sharp rise in inequality over the long 20th century. Second, we demonstrate that this U-shaped pattern only really holds for a handful of industrialized economies and a subset of developing countries. Finally, we provide a unified framework centered on two unorthodox assumptions that can explain inequality patterns beyon...},
